        <p>The history of British Museum</p>

        The creation of the British Museum was the result of the legacy of 
        Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753), a physician, naturalist and collector. 
        An Act of Parliament was passed on 7 June 1753, authorising the establishment 
        of the British Museum on the basis of this collection.
        
        In this internationally famous museum, it is an interesting question that 
        how to collect these antiques.  Sloan collected over 71,000 objects 
        during his lifetime. He wanted the collection to be preserved as a whole 
        even after his death. He therefore bequeathed his entire collection 
        to the then King George II, who donated it to the nation in 1757, 
        and the Old Royal Library, which had been donated to the nation by King George II, 
        was added to the collection in 1823. The same year, King George IV donated 
        his father's book collection - the King's Library - to the nation.

        <p>The venture of web</p>
        The museum is actively expanding its collection each year for the audiences 
        who come to see the artifacts. This is because visitors want to learn about the history 
        of objects and appreciate their beauty. It is curious for people who have visited museum
        that how can it exist. In fact, the British Museum's reputation is based on the quantity and quality 
        of its collections, which could only have been built up over time in coordination with the British Empire.
        Another fabulous part of this web is the taxonomy.The British Museum is currently divided into 10 research 
        and specialised collections, based on their regional areas and the type of artefacts they contain.
